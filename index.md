I manage <a href="https://www.addide.no" rel="nofollow"><strong>Addidé</strong></a>, a specialized makerspace primarily for local businesses, in collaboration with **Lindesnesregionen Næringshage**. Our goal is to promote 3D design and 3D printing within the community.

Typical requests include creating a digital copy of an existing physical part and 3D printing it with materials suited to specific environmental needs, or to assist with quick design prototyping. We are also capable of smaller batch productions.

Our makerspace features an evolving mix of FFF and SLA 3D printers, CNC machines, post-processing equipment, and a large workshop equipped with electronics and woodworking tools. We also track locally available equipment and facilitate connections through our network.
