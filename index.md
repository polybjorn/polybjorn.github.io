# About me

I manage [**Addidé**](https://www.addide.no), a specialized makerspace primarily for local businesses, with **Lindesnesregionen Næringshage** in Mandal. Our goal is to establish 3D design and 3D printing in the community.

Learn about 3D design, collaborate on projects, or place orders for designs you already have. 

Typical requests is to create a digital twin of a physical model or part, and then 3D print with materials that is suitable to the environment you need them to be in, or simply a physical prototype of a 3D model.

We're equipped with various FFF and SLA 3D printers, a 3-axis CNC, post-processing machines and tools, and a large workshop mixed with electronics and woodworking equipment. We also take note of equipment available locally, and are happy to enable connections through our network.

If you're looking to explore 3D design, our makerspace is your resource center.
