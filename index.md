I manage <a href="https://www.addide.no" rel="nofollow"><strong>Addidé</strong></a>, a makerspace primarily for local projects and businesses, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.naringshagen.no" rel="nofollow"><strong>Lindesnesregionen Næringshage</strong></a>.

I like to make functional designs, and share editable formats with a free and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" rel="nofollow"><strong>open licensing</strong></a>.
