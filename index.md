I manage <a href="https://www.addide.no" rel="nofollow"><strong>Addidé</strong></a>, a makerspace serving local projects and businesses, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.naringshagen.no" rel="nofollow"><strong>Lindesnesregionen Næringshage</strong></a>.

We support additive manufacturing within the community by offering 3D modelling services, equipment maintenance, and production runs from prototype to medium-volume batches.
