I manage <a href="https://www.addide.no" rel="nofollow"><strong>Addidé</strong></a>, a makerspace primarily for local projects and businesses, in collaboration with **Lindesnesregionen Næringshage**. Our goal is to promote 3D design and 3D printing within the community.

Typical requests include creating a digital copy of an existing physical part and 3D printing it with materials suited to specific environmental needs, to assist with quick design prototyping, or smaller batch productions.

My work is shaped by essentialism and open-source values. I’m driven by an interest in exploring materials and finding sustainable solutions to create designs that are efficient, accessible, and adaptable.
