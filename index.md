I manage <a href="https://www.addide.no" rel="nofollow"><strong>Addidé</strong></a>, a makerspace primarily for local projects and businesses, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.naringshagen.no" rel="nofollow"><strong>Lindesnesregionen Næringshage</strong></a>. Our goal is to promote 3D design and 3D printing within the community.

Typical requests include creating a digital copy of an existing physical part and 3D printing it with materials suited to specific environmental needs, to assist with quick design prototyping, or smaller batch productions.
