I manage [**Addidé**](https://www.addide.no), a specialized makerspace primarily for local businesses, in collaboration with **Lindesnesregionen Næringshage** in Mandal. Our goal is to promote 3D design and 3D printing within the community.

Typical requests include creating a digital copy of an existing physical part and 3D printing it with materials suited to specific environmental needs, or quickly producing a physical prototype from a 3D model.

Our makerspace features an evolving mix of FFF and SLA 3D printers, CNC machines, post-processing equipment, and a large workshop equipped with electronics and woodworking tools. We also track locally available equipment and facilitate connections through our network.

Addidé is located at **Hollendergata 3**, 4514 Mandal.
