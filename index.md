# About me

I manage Addidé, a specialized makerspace for local businesses, with Lindesnesregionen Næringshage in Mandal. Our goal is to democratize 3D design for the local business community.

This space serves as a central point where companies can come to learn about 3D design, collaborate on projects, and even place orders for designs they need. We're equipped with various FFF and SLA 3D printers, 3-axis CNC, post-processing machines and tools, and a large workshop mixed with electronics and woodworking equipment.

If you're looking to explore 3D design, our makerspace is your resource center. Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to refine your skills, we provide the tools and space for you to advance your business capabilities.

We envision our makerspace as a modern complement to the traditional makerspace workshop.
