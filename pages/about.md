# **About me**

Hi! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** and I live in southern Norway.<br>

I work in a variety of roles related to 3D design, using 3D printers, CNC, and manual woodworking. I also have experience with both vector and pixel graphic design software, which I use to create functional, adaptable, and minimal designs. I would define myself as an essentialist.

I'm passionate about staying organized, and I use tools like Obsidian and Eagle to keep track of all my notes and files. As someone who works multiple jobs, I know how important it is to be able to quickly find what I need, when I need it.

One of my core values is the open-source philosophy. I believe that sharing designs and knowledge is key to fostering a vibrant and innovative design community. I'm always looking for ways to share my expertise with others, and to help people discover the power and potential of these tools.

In addition to my design work, I'm deeply committed to sustainability. I spend a lot of time researching and exploring ways to minimize my use of synthetic materials and make more sustainable choices in all areas of my life. I believe that we all have a responsibility to take care of our planet, and I'm proud to do my part in promoting a more sustainable way of living.
