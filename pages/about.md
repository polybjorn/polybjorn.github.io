# **About Me**

Hi! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** and I live in southern Norway.<br>

A few years ago I was introduced to 3D printing, which led me to recently build my own machine with a Duet webserver. With a lot of help I learned that making stuff with CNCs and lasercutters is very similar. Because I enjoy the grind, I have recreated several common design series like IKEA and other kitchen producers, which I have used to refresh kitchens, bathrooms and workshops for a fraction of the cost.

Started selfhosting with Docker. My current goal now that I feel comfortable with all my images is to continue to incorporate CNCF projects as I go. At the time of writing I'm trying to get more comfortable with zsh and writing Ansible playbooks. I dream of a low-power cluster network with off-site nodes, automated with Ansible and Kubernetes.

I have learned vector design using Serif Affinity software, which I have since started recommending to everyone's wallets. Having a technical writer job redesigning manuals using Affinity Publisher have probably borrowed heavily from all the YAML templating that started before it.

I think I have become comfortable juggling all of this because I try to keep a minimal digital footprint, and I organize as much as possible using Eagle. I would however not be able to do any of it without the people I've met in Mandal.

Reach out using telegram or email linked at the bottom of the page. Thanks you!
