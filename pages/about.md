# **About me**

Hi! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** and I live in southern Norway.<br>

A few years ago I was introduced to 3D printing, which led me to recently build my own machine with a Duet webserver. With a lot of help I learned that making stuff with CNCs and lasercutters is very similar. I have recreated several common design series from IKEA and other kitchen producers, which I have used to refresh kitchens, bathrooms and workshops for a fraction of the cost.

Started selfhosting with Docker. My current goal is to continue to incorporate Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects as I go. I want to selfhost with a low-power cluster network with off-site nodes, automated with Ansible and Kubernetes.

I have learned vector design using Serif Affinity software, which I have since started recommending to everyone's wallets. Having a technical writer job redesigning manuals using Affinity Publisher have probably borrowed heavily from all the YAML templating that started before it.

I think I have become comfortable juggling this because I try to keep a minimal digital footprint, and I organize as much as possible using Eagle and Agenda. I would however not be able to do any of it without the people I've met in Mandal.

Reach out using the links at the bottom of the page. Thanks you!
