Until fairly recently, clothes were very ambiguous to me. They werenâ€™t as long-lasting as furniture or tools, but also not as disposable as a consumable, like personal care products. Moreover, regarding materials, clothes can easily be fully organic and still be unsustainably sourced or produced. I probably have clothes made by people, or possibly children, not paid or protected as we would expect in our part of the world.

The cost discrepancy between easily accessible clothes and sustainable clothes is significant. Nowadays, everyone wants to brand themselves as environmentally friendly, making it easy to find clothes tagged as responsibly produced or using recycled materials. However, this information is usually limited to a single sentence without any easily accessible proof. In writing this post, I found cheap clothing branded as sustainable that had only 30% recycled cotton and an unnamed certification as proof. Pier One tops on Zalando, which is one of their most common brands, and by far the most common in their sustainable clothing category, were an example.

Unlike electronics or furniture producers who often have their own detailed product pages with technical specifications, manuals, and vendor lists, fashion companies usually provide very general information or certifications. However, in a world where prominent European brands like IKEA, Jysk, Zara, ASOS, H&M, Nestle, and Carlsberg have all been reported using forced labor in the last 5 years, a vague list of certifications does not suffice.

As I try to switch to organic and/or sustainable clothes, I also have to accept that for some items, it may be impossible to find completely sustainable options. Without making significant compromises, shoes are almost impossible to make with 100% organic materials. All certifications shouldn't be disregarded, but recycled materials are not the end goal. Recycled synthetics are still synthetic and unsustainable in large volumes. The plastic needs to be processed, used, and then thrown away, generating microplastics along the way before it can be processed yet again in eco-certified products.

It's important to note that just because a product uses organic materials, it can still be highly unsustainable. For instance, IKEA reportedly makes products using illegally harvested or stolen timber from Madagascar, Russia, Ukraine, and Romania. However, it should be noted that IKEA denies all individual allegations and claims that strict policies are in place to avoid this.

Some companies specialize in using 3D printing, such as Adidas' "Futurecraft 4D," New Balance's "Zante Generate," and Nike's "Flyprint." Printing enables custom products that increase durability and enable a larger range of materials. Although they are not focusing on being organic products, they are highly specialized for their purpose.

Instead of listing companies, I'd rather point out ethically produced materials to look for. Soles are generally wholly synthetic, but they can be made of recycled materials like PET bottles or car tires, or include natural rubber. If you can accept non-vegan materials, look for vegetable-tanned leather. Other biodegradable materials include natural rubber, organic cotton, and cork.

I recently discovered barefoot shoes, which are shoes made with a thin and flat sole and often come with a larger toe box to allow your toes to splay and move more freely. This type of shoe can help increase balance and reduce the risk of injuries.

A thinner sole in barefoot shoes decreases the risk of foot injuries by allowing for a more natural and proprioceptive experience. Proprioception refers to the body's ability to sense its position, movement, and orientation in space. When wearing thick-soled shoes, the proprioceptive input from the foot is reduced, which can lead to altered gait patterns and decreased stability.

From an environmental perspective, barefoot shoes require less material per shoe. Specialized shoes are generally more expensive, but they often have higher quality materials, which lead to improved durability. Higher quality shoes also promote maintenance awareness, either solely influenced by their initial cost, or directly from their manufacturers.

I recently purchased barefoot sneakers made of locally sourced materials (mainly leather) and shipped in fully organic packaging for 1,600 NOK. However, the soles are not made from organic materials, but they're also much thinner than what I've used before. Until now, I've used shoes that cost 200 NOK each, but I've been wearing out 2-3 pairs each year as well. Hopefully, these new shoes will benefit my gait and reduce my carbon footprint, while not really being much more expensive in the long term.
