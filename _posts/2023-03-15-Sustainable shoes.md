Clothes can easily be fully organic and still be unsustainably sourced or produced. They can be made with heavily processed or stolen organic materials, in dangerous factories, and even by forced labor. Even without all that, a significant environmental cost is the material and product transportation.

Unlike electronics or furniture producers who often have their own detailed product pages with technical specifications, manuals, and vendor lists, fashion companies usually provide very general information or certifications. However, in a world where prominent European brands like IKEA, Jysk, Zara, ASOS, H&M, Nestle, and Carlsberg have all been reported using forced labor in the last 5 years, a vague list of certifications does not suffice.

As I try to switch to organic and sustainable clothes, I also have to balance function with completely sustainable options. Without making significant compromises, shoes quickly become very difficult to make with only organic materials. At some point, there have to be a compromise between "fully organic" and "responsibly produced". Recycled synthetics are still synthetic and unsustainable in large volumes. The plastic needs to be processed, used, and then thrown away, generating microplastics along the way before it can be processed yet again.

Some companies specialize in using 3D printing, such as Adidas' "Futurecraft 4D," New Balance's "Zante Generate," and Nike's "Flyprint." Printing enables custom products that increase durability and enable a larger range of materials. Although they are not focusing on being organic products, they are highly specialized for their purpose.

It's important to note that just because a product uses organic materials, it can still be highly unsustainable. For instance, IKEA reportedly makes products using illegally harvested or stolen timber from Madagascar, Russia, Ukraine, and Romania. However, it should be noted that IKEA denies all individual allegations and claims that strict policies are in place to avoid this.

Soles are generally wholly synthetic, but they can be made of recycled materials like PET bottles or car tires, or include natural rubber. In terms of leather, look for vegetable-tanned, real leather. Other biodegradable materials include natural rubber, organic cotton, and cork.

I recently discovered barefoot shoes, which are shoes made with a thin and flat sole and often come with a larger toe box to allow your toes to splay and move more freely. This type of shoe can help increase balance and reduce the risk of injuries.

A thinner sole in barefoot shoes decreases the risk of foot injuries by allowing for a more natural and proprioceptive experience. Proprioception refers to the body's ability to sense its position, movement, and orientation in space. When wearing thick-soled shoes, the proprioceptive input from the foot is reduced, which can lead to altered gait patterns and decreased stability.

From an environmental perspective, barefoot shoes require less material per shoe. Specialized shoes are generally more expensive, but they often have higher quality materials, which lead to improved durability. Higher quality shoes also promote maintenance awareness, either solely influenced by their initial cost, or directly from their manufacturers.

I recently purchased barefoot sneakers made of locally sourced materials (mainly leather) and shipped in fully organic packaging for 1,600 NOK. However, the soles are not made from organic materials, but they're also much thinner than what I've used before. Until now, I've used shoes that cost 200 NOK each, but I've been wearing out 2-3 pairs each year as well. Hopefully, these new shoes will benefit my gait and reduce my carbon footprint, while not really being much more expensive in the long term.
