Until fairly recently, clothes were very ambiguous to me. They weren’t as long-lasting as furniture or tools, but also not as disposable as a consumable, like personal care products. Moreover, regarding materials, clothes can easily be fully organic and still be unsustainably sourced or produced. I probably have clothes made by people, or possibly children, not paid or protected as we would expect in our part of the world.

The cost discrepancy between easily accessible clothes and sustainable clothes is also significant. Nowadays, everyone wants to brand themselves as environmentally friendly, making it easy to find clothes with "50%+ organically sourced materials" or recycled polyester. Still, it's usually a single sentence of information, without any easily accessible proof.

Unlike electronics or furniture producers who often have their own detailed product pages with technical specifications, manuals and vendor lists - fashion companies usually provide very general information, or their certifications. In a world where prominent European brands like IKEA, Jysk, Zara, ASOS, H&M, Nestle, and Carlsberg, among others, have all been caught using forced labor in the last 5 years, a vague list of certifications just doesn't cut it.

As I try to switch to organic and/or sustainable clothes, I also have to accept that for some items, it may be impossible to find completely sustainable options. Without making significant compromises, shoes are impossible to make with 100% organic materials. All certifications shouldn't be disregarded, but recycled materials are not the end goal. Recycled polyester is still plastic, and it is unsustainable in a large volumes. The plastic needs to first be processed, used, and then thrown away, generating microplastics along the way, before it can be processed yet again in eco-certified products.

Just because a product uses organic materials, it can also be highly unsustainable. For instance, IKEA reportedly makes products using illegally harvested or stolen timber from Madagascar, Russia, Ukraine, and Romania, although it should be noted that IKEA denies the allegations and claims that strict policies are in place to avoid this.

Some companies specialize in using 3D printing, such as Adidas' "Futurecraft 4D," New Balance's "Zante Generate," and Nike's "Flyprint." FFF and SLS printing enables custom products that increase durability and enable a larger range of materials, but they are far from fully organic products.

Instead of listing companies, I'd rather point out ethically produced materials to look for. Soles are generally wholly synthetic, but they can be made of recycled materials like PET bottles or car tires, or include natural rubber. If you can accept non-vegan materials, look for vegetable-tanned leather. Other biodegradable materials include natural rubber, organic cotton, and cork.

I recently discovered barefoot shoes, which are shoes made with a thin and flat sole and often come with a larger toe box to allow your toes to splay and move more freely. This type of shoe can help increase balance and reduce the risk of injuries.

A thinner sole in barefoot shoes decreases the risk of foot injuries by allowing for a more natural and proprioceptive experience. Proprioception refers to the body's ability to sense its position, movement, and orientation in space. When wearing thick-soled shoes, the proprioceptive input from the foot is reduced, which can lead to altered gait patterns and decreased stability.

From an environmental perspective, barefoot shoes require less material per shoe. Specialized shoes are generally more expensive, but they often have higher quality materials, which lead to improved durability. Higher quality shoes also promote maintenance awareness, either solely influenced by their initial cost, or directly from their manufacturers.

I recently purchased barefoot sneakers made of locally sourced materials (mainly leather), shipped in fully organic packaging for 1,600 NOK. Still, the soles are not made from organic materials, but they're also much thinner than what I have used before. I have until now used shoes that cost 200 NOK each, but I sincerely expect to not wear out 2–3 pairs of shoes each year anymore either, which I hope means I'm not actually using much more money on shoes long-term.
