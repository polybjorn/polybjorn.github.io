# Ratrig V-Core Pro 1.3

My conclusion is that I wish I didn't do this so early, but I'm happy now that it is finally working.

I'm using E3D's Titan Aero extruder with EVA (v2.3.0) for linear rails and BLTouch. The printbed is custom-made tempered glass. The hardware mount and casing is truly a WIP, but I'm not in a rush.
