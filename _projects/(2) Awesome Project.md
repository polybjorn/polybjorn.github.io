# Cutting boards

I like to make these in batches to improve from last time, and to keep on hand as gifts. This far I feel limited by the quality of wood I have been using, but I am also very impressed by the results.

My current challenges:
- Too slow sanding techniques
- Optimal library management of design options

The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.
