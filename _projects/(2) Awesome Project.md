# Cutting boards

I like to make these in batches and to keep on hand as gifts. I treat them food-grade, but at the same time I think the quality of wood have not been good enough to recommend it as such, yet. However if I do get better quality, I'm not wasting the opportunity to try making end grain blocks.

It's been a great way to speedrun the production process and mass production techniques.
